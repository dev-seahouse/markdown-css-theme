# markdown-css-theme
## What is this
This is a markdown theme i personally used for knowledge documentation/notes taking together with Marxico  

Evernote still does not support markdown/proper formatting features after being requested for many years. 
It seems like to date, the closest option for those few like me who want nicely formatted, easy to read/review documents, or simply markdown support for whatever reason but refuse to leave evernote for some kind of reason, then [Marxico](https://marxi.co/) is perhaps the only decent option for now.
