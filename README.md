## What is this
This is a markdown theme i personally used for knowledge documentation/notes taking together with Marxico  

Evernote still does not support markdown/proper formatting features after being requested for many years. 
It seems like to-date, for those like myself who need nicely formatted, easy to read/review documents, or simply markdown support for whatever reason but still not ready to leave evernote for some reason, the only almost decent workaround is to rely on [Marxico](https://marxi.co/).
